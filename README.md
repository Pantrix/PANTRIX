## Overview
### Description
Because of COVID-19, many individuals have decided to eat less at restaurants and go out as little as possible. As a result, we decided to create an app that will aid these individuals in finding recipes with ingredients they have at home. Users will be able to input the ingredients they have at hand and receive recipe recommendations. The recipes would also include nutritional information as well as pricing of the ingredients.
